# Introduction

## What is EXODUS?

EXODUS is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the EXO token. Each EXO token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, wFTM, gOHM, MAI) in the EXODUS treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. EXODUS also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking, bonding and treasury investment strategies.

`We are an extension of OlympusDAO built on the Cronos chain and will be part of OlympusDAOs Bretton Woods re-imagination.`

There was no team allocation of tokens, there was no presale.


## What is the purpose of EXODUS?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behaviour of the EXO token is controlled at a high level. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that EXO can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

Further to this we aim to become the decentralized reserve currency of Cronos, building partnerships through investment strategies, EXO use cases, on-boarding of users to Cronos and an education system. With further developments and opportunities arising in the future.

## How do I participate in EXODUS?

There are two main strategies for market participants: [staking](using-the-website/stake-your-exod/) and [bonding](using-the-website/purchase-a-bond/). Stakers stake their EXO tokens in return for more EXO tokens, while bonders provide LP, DAI or wFTM tokens in exchange for discounted EXO tokens after a fixed vesting period.

As we are a community run DAO we also have various roles available for contribution, for more information please join our discord server and speak with an Architect or Moderator.

## How can I benefit from EXODUS?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new EXO tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in EXO and thus the bonder's profit would depend on EXO price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static EXO price.

## Who created EXODUS?

EXODUS is a fork of [**Olympus**](https://www.olympusdao.finance) on the Cronos Network. Our team has a mix of anonymous operators and fully doxed members.
We are a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation and the growth of our team will have a correlation with the growth of our community.

## Who runs EXODUS?

As explained above we are a DAO and thus, governance decisions are executed in the following methods.

* Policy decisions are currently decided within the core team until sufficient growth in the community and education of the community enables policy decisions to be decided through snapshot voting.
* Investment, Funding and Community developments are decided by the community via a snapshot vote and then executed upon conclusion of that voting result.
