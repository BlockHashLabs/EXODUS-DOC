# Asset Security

All transactions made by the EXODUS DAO must pass through our multi-sig safety net.

Multi-signatures are special contracts which act as wallets. They require a certain threshold of signers to approve transactions before they can be executed. In this way, multi-sigs act to protect the community by avoiding a single point of failure.
We have three different multi-sig wallets.

## Team Wallet
**Description**: Has ownership of the contracts (except the treasury) and can change policy. Requires 3/5 signatures.

## DAO Wallet
**Description**: Contains the treasury. Also holds the team funds, in EXOD, which are minted when bonds are sold. These funds are for development purposes. Requires 3/5 signatures.

## Ethereum Wallet
**Description**: Holds the EXODUSdao.eth domain. Requires 3/5 signatures.


**For added security, our DAO Wallet and Ethereum Wallet require signatures from leading Fantom Community members.**

These members are shown below.
