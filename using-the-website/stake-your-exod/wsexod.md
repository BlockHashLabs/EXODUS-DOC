<!-- # What is the purpose of wsEXO?

wsEXO is the abbreviation for `wrapped staked EXO`, which is the wrapped version of sEXOD.

A wrapped token's value is pegged to that of another token. In our case wsEXO derives its value from the following calculation:

$$
Current market value of EXO * Current Index = wsEXO value
$$

As the current index increases with each rebase, so does the value of wsEXO relative to the current price of EXO.

In some tax jurisdictions a rebase reward is considered a taxable income. Holding wsEXO removes this taxable event. Effectively, you are still collecting rebase rewards through the current index multiplier as your wsEXO increases in value through the above equation. 

You may also deposit your wsEXO into ‘The Monolith’ LP on Beethoven-x and gain LP tokens. We recommend balancing your deposit to the pool by using 50% EXO and 50% wsEXO. These can then be used to [bond](../../using-the-website/purchase-a-bond/the-monolith-lp-bond.md) or you can hold them to earn the APR from the pool.

*At this time, we would not recommend holding LP tokens unless you plan on using them to bond.*

**Future use cases for wsEXO**
  * wsEXO could be used as collateral.
  * wsEXO could be used cross chain.
