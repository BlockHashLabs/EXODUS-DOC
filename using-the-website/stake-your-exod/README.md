<!-- # Stake Your EXO (ðŸ§ª,ðŸ§ª)

Staking allows you to earn EXO passively via auto-compounding. By staking your EXO with EXODUS, you receive sEXO (staked EXO) in return at a 1:1 ratio. After that, your sEXO balance will increase automatically on every epoch based on the current APY

## How to Buy EXO

1. Go to [this BeethovenX swap page](https://beets.fi/#/trade/fantom/0x3b57f3feaaf1e8254ec680275ee6e7727c7413c7).
2. Make sure the output currency is EXO. You can also copy and paste the EXO contract address _0x3b57f3feaaf1e8254ec680275ee6e7727c7413c7_ into the output currency field to ensure you are swapping for the right token.
3. You can select any input currency based on your available wallet balance. It is recommended to use MAI as the input currency to minimize the slippage.
4. Select the amount of EXO you want to swap for. Then click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Swap" and sign the transaction.
6. You should see EXO in your wallet balance now after the swap transaction is successful. If you cannot find it in your wallet, add EXO contract address _0x3b57f3feaaf1e8254ec680275ee6e7727c7413c7_ to your wallet.

The "Approve" transaction is only needed when you swap EXO for the first time; subsequent swapping only requires you to perform the "Swap" transaction.

## Reading the Info

**APY** tells you the annualized rate of return based on the reward yield. It takes into account the effect of compounding since sEXO rebases exponentially.

**TVL** measures the dollar amount of all the staked EXO in EXODUS.

**Current Index** allows you to track your gain from staking. The index started from 1 at epoch 0, and increases every epoch. If you staked at genesis (epoch 0) and never unstaked any EXO, your balance today would be X times greater, where X is the current index. You can use the index to track your position by marking down the index number when you stake and unstake. You divide the index number when you unstake by the index number when you stake to get the ratio by which your sEXO balance has increased.

**Your Balance** tells you how many unstaked EXO are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can stake.

**Your Staked Balance** tells you how many staked EXO are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can unstake.

**Next Rebase** tells you the remaining time until the next rebase.

**Reward Yield** tells you how much your sEXO balance will increase when the next epoch begins. For example, if you stake 100 EXO and the upcoming rebase is 0.5427%, your sEXO balance would increase from 100 to 100.5427.

**ROI (5-Day Rate)** estimates how much your sEXO balance will increase after 5 days, if the reward yield stays the same during this period. For example, if you stake 100 EXO and the rate is 8.4577%, your sEXO balance would increase from 100 to 108.4577 after 5 days. -->
