# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of EXODUS.** Stakers stake their EXOD on [the EXODUS website](https://https://dao.exodusdefi.com/stake) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from [bond sales](bonding.md), and can vary based on the number of EXO staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of EXOD translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of EXO drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your EXO balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock EXO and receive an equal amount of sEXO.** Your sEXO balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sEXO is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sEXOD and receive an equal amount of EXO.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked EXO (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
